# AmExpert2019Hackathon
This repo has the code I used for AmExpert 2019. The Data files are not uploaded here and neither are the final submission csv files. The final submission csv files however can be obtained simply by running through the jupyter notebooks put up here.  

`Amexpert-2019.ipynb` notebook contains a lot of EDA, pre-processing and feature engineering code, as well as some initial attempts at the solution. However, these features ended up highly overfitting for us.  
`Amexpert-2019-baseline.ipynb` notebook contains different sets of features (inspired from https://github.com/HiteshGorana/AmExpert-2019), although slightly tweaked. They also have bayesian optimisation of hyperparameters done for xgboost and the code for my final submissions which achieved public LB ROC AUC score of 0.878.
